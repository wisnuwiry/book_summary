## Growing as Mobile Engineer

If you are playing the long-game in growing as an engineer, you are wise to focus on professional and not only titles.

Mentorship is a learning relationship betwwen an experienced person and someone want to grow. Finding mentor is great to grew faster.

If you are already at a senior or above level, mentoring someone less experienced is a fantastic way for your learn.

Sometimes, the best way to grow could be changeing job/team. With change jobs, can gain a lot more:

- Better compensation
- A more prestigous title
- Expand personal network
- Learn new tech
- Learn new industry
- And many more

And sometimes, many people find job with down-levelling, with this reason:

- No real-world experices
- No enough experience
- Down level would still fit salary expectation

## Growing to Senior

Covering all engineering aspects of the platform, not just the frameworks / APIs, was key to these engineers mastering the stack. They would get to a proficient level with testing, using debugging tools, performance monitoring, crash reporting, animations, analytics, and most areas covered in the book Building Mobile Apps at Scale.

Both iOS and Android change so fast that you can never know it all. But the good news is you do not need to be familiar with every last framework! After you are proficient with the stack and have covered most parts, you can decide which areas to deep dive into. More importantly, you can decide when to turn your attention to the other stacks.

Creating the opportubity to work with other teams, not just iOS or Android, but also backend, web, data science, product and other, is something productive engineers proactively did. You do not need permission to talk with data scientists, web engineer, or any person in tech company if you would often spot an opportunity such as new project and you often start new collaborate on their own.

> A great way to grow as a mobile engineer is to not pigeonhole yourself as "mobile engineer", you start who can "and should!" wolve problems where they arise.

As a mobile engineer shipping a product that customers use, you are in a perfect spot to become a product-aware and product-minded engineer and deliver more impact. You already know the ins and outs of the user interface, and you probably work with designers and product managers. These are the very people you want to have access to, in order to become more product-aware.

This is a few tips to work well to grwo product minded muscle:

- Understand how and why your company is successful
- Build s strong relationship with your product manager
- Engage in user research, customer support, and other activities
- Bring weel-backed product suggestions to the table
- Offer product/engineering trageoffs
- Ask feedback from product manager

Proactively gathering feedback from your peers about how you can get better is a much more efficient way to grow. Here are various opportunities when you can ask for feedback and get more actionable responses, than if you simply ask your manager, "Hey, can you give me some feedback?"

Leading a project with several technologies forces you to understand how all parts work at a high level. Assuming you are an iOS engineer, you need to confirm that the Android plan makes sense and get a grip on what the backend team is doing. You could delegate all this work to the Android and backend engineers, however, that is sloppy leadership. 

You should ask for the opportunity to lead a cross-discipline project once you are proficient with your main stack and have some familiarity with the other stacks.

> If you do not ask for or talk about that promotion with your manager, do not expect to get it.
