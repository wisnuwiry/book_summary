### From Past to Present

Humans have had a survival instinct since ancient times by solving problems. So, as an engineer, we need to have the ability to solve a problem as a philosophical basis.

### The Product

A product is made to solve a problem, and a product can be different ways to solve the problem. And as software engineers, we solve problems with code, but the code still serves the purpose of the product. We can't solve a problem with our code, without understanding the details of the product and its purpose.

### Conflict of Interest

The most essential of being a product minded engineer is to resolve the conflict beetween two spaces and develop high quality and reliable product. And necessary to understanding the problem space first, because people always look for the answers to the problem.

### Common Characteristic of a Well-Thought Product

Software engineering is analysing customer and business requirements and the designing, developing, build and testing sotware applications to meet those requirements.

Many software product on the market today that serve various industries. Often as developer focus on creating good product that work, but forget to consider other aspects that can make a product extradionary. So need to incorporate fundamental characteristic of a software into your software core functionality to have outstanding product.

  Functionality refers to wheter a product works and helps the user meet their goals and needs.

2. **Usability**
  
  > "Usability us about human behaviour. It recognizes that humans are lazy, get emotional, are not interesting in putting a lot effort into, say, geting a credit card and generally prefer things that are easy to do vs those that are hard to do"

  Usability => how well a specific user within a particular context can use a product to achive a defined goal efftively, efficiencly, and satisfactory.
  
  In short usability, users can should to less effort to learn and use our products. And in usability depends on five basic priciples:
